## 2 December

-Introduction to how we are going to work
	-First we will work on our own different notebooks. 
	-On meetings we will discuss and merge important code or ideas to a new notebook. 

-Key Points
	- We are not using binary variables for now as we can use them later for customer strategies. 
	- Delete this variables and only leave Continous variables for now. 
	- For Durations there is a lot of people getting to 0. 
	- After checking with last time of visit and creating a filter we decrease the number of 0. 
	- Duration, dates, as last visit, visits are key values we can use. 
	- Add new variables, like recency which was calculated by the last date in general with last date of people.
	- Frecuency also. 
	- There are some correlations we can look on.

Next Meeting (December 9 at 11 am):
	- Check all values,
	- Data Cleaning
	- Create more variables that might be useful, new ideas.
