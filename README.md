# DM_2023_project

This project will leverage the dataset provided by the companyâ€™s ERP system, which includes a
wealth of customer-related data, collected between June 1st 2014 and October 31st 2019. The
objective of the company is to create a data-driven strategy that will enable it to better understand
its customers, deliver more personalized services, and optimize marketing efforts.
To do this we will apply clustering techniques to segment the customers, as
well as combine and analyze the results. Another goal is to understand the value and demographics
of each customer segment, as well as gain insights into the different sports activities that customers
prefer to participate in.
